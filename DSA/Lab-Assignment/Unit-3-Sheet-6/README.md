### Tree Implementations:
- Implement classes for **Binary Tree**, **Binary Search Tree**, and **AVL Tree** with insertion, deletion, and traversal methods.
- Implement tree traversal methods: **in-order**, **pre-order**, **post-order**.

### Graph Implementations:
- Create a **Graph** class with methods for adding and removing nodes and edges.
- Implement graph traversal algorithms: **BFS** and **DFS**.
- Implement shortest path algorithms: **Dijkstra‚Äôs** and **Bellman-Ford**.
