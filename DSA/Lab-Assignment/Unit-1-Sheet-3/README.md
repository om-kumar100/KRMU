## üß™ Test Cases
| Test Case               | Input                                      | Expected Output                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Array Operations | `insert(1), insert(2), delete(1), traverse()` | `[2]`                                                |
| Dynamic Array Operations| `insert(1), insert(2), delete(1), traverse()` | `[2]`                                                |
| String Concatenation    | `"hello" + "world"`                        | `"helloworld"`                                       |
| Substring Extraction    | Substring of `"hello"` from index `2`, length `3` | `"llo"`                                             |
| String Comparison       | `"abc"` and `"abc"`                        | `True`                                               |
| Character Frequency     | `"hello"`                                  | `{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}`                   |

## üìà Algorithm Analysis
### Time Complexity Analysis
- **Static Array**:
  - Insertion: \( O(1) \)
  - Deletion: \( O(n) \)
  - Traversal: \( O(n) \)

- **Dynamic Array**:
  - Insertion (with resizing): \( O(n) \), amortized \( O(1) \)
  - Deletion: \( O(n) \)
  - Traversal: \( O(n) \)

- **String Operations**:
  - Concatenation: \( O(m + n) \)
  - Substring: \( O(k) \)
  - Comparison: \( O(\min(m, n)) \)
  - Character Frequency: \( O(n) \)
