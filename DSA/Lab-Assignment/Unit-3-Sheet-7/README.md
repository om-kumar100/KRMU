# Disaster Response Management System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a disaster response management system that utilizes tree and graph data structures to manage and coordinate disaster response efforts. The system will manage information about affected regions, resources, and rescue operations, ensuring that help reaches the affected people promptly.

## Data Structures Used
- **AVL Trees**: Used for managing hierarchical data of affected regions.
- **Graphs**: Used to represent the affected regions and resource centers. Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) are implemented.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra‚Äôs and Bellman-Ford algorithms are used to determine the quickest route for resource delivery.
- **Spanning Tree Algorithms**: Prim‚Äôs and Kruskal‚Äôs algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree.

## Features
1. **AVL Tree Operations**: Insertion, Deletion, and Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order).
2. **Graph Operations**: Adding/removing nodes, BFS and DFS traversals, Dijkstra‚Äôs and Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithms, Prim‚Äôs and Kruskal‚Äôs algorithms for minimum spanning tree.
3. **Disaster Response Management System**: Interactive interface to visualize affected areas and resources.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the system.
4. For a graphical user interface (GUI), implement one using frameworks such as Tkinter, PyQt, or web-based tools.

## Test Cases
- **AVL Tree Insertion**: Insert regions and check in-order traversal.
- **Graph BFS Traversal**: Add edges and perform BFS traversal.
- **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**: Add edges with weights and check shortest path.
- **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**: Add edges and perform minimum spanning tree operation.

## Repository Contents
- `main.cpp`: Contains the implementation of AVL Trees, Graphs, and algorithms.
 
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
